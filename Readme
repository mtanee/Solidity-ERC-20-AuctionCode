This repository contains a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity for conducting auctions. It allows users to place bids and the owner of the contract to end the auction and declare a winner. Below is an overview of the functionality and usage of the Auction smart contract.

Contract Details
Name: Auction
License: GPL-3.0
Solidity Version: >=0.7.0 <0.9.0
Features
Bidding: Participants can place bids with a specified amount.

Auction Duration: The owner of the contract sets the duration of the auction during contract deployment.

Ending the Auction: The owner can end the auction when the auction's duration has passed.

Withdraw Funds: Participants can withdraw their bid amount if they were not the highest bidder or if the auction has ended.

Events: The contract emits events for new bids and when the auction ends.

Smart Contract Functions
constructor(uint _durationMinutes)
Initializes the contract with the owner and the auction's end time based on the given duration in minutes.
bid()
Allows participants to place bids. Bids must be higher than the current highest bid.
endAuction()
Only the owner can call this function to end the auction once the auction's duration has passed.
withdraw()
Participants can use this function to withdraw their bid amount if they were not the highest bidder or if the auction has ended.
Modifiers
onlyOwner: Ensures that only the owner of the contract can execute certain functions.

onlyBeforeEnd: Ensures that certain functions can only be executed before the auction ends.

Events
NewBid(address bidder, uint amount): Emits when a new bid is placed.

AuctionEnded(address winner, uint amount): Emits when the auction ends, specifying the winner and the winning bid amount.

How to Use
Deploy the smart contract, specifying the auction duration in minutes.

Participants can call the bid() function to place bids.

The owner can end the auction using the endAuction() function after the specified duration has passed.

Participants can withdraw their funds using the withdraw() function if they were not the highest bidder or if the auction has ended.
